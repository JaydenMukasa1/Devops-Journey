Level 3 → 4

Task
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

Solutions 
Used cd to change to the inhere directory, ls showed nothing because the file was hidden. So I used find to list all files, and  found ./...Hiding-From-You
Then used cat ./...Hiding-From-You to view the password.

Key Commands 
cd
ls 
find 
cat
