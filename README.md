# Devops-Journey

This repository tracks my learning journey into DevOps and the tools related.

## Aim
To Build solid fundamentals in Linux, Bash, Git, Networking and core DevOps tools. As well as maintain a clear, public record of progress and real skills.

## Structure
The repo is organised by topic:

- `Linux/` – notes, commands, and exercises  
  - `Bandit/` – level-by-level notes and solutions from the OverTheWire Bandit wargame
- `Bash/` – scripts and shell exercises (to be added)
- `Git/` – Git concepts, commands, and examples (to be added)
- `Networking/` – notes and practical examples (to be added)

Future folders:
- `Docker/`
- `AWS/`
- `Terraform`
- `CI-CD`
- `Kubernetes`

## How I Use This Repo
- Focus on short, practical notes instead of long theory
- Each Bandit level includes:
  - Task
  - Solution in my own words
  - Key commands used  
- Includes a growing Linux cheat sheet based on real commands I use regularly
